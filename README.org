* Featured Talk Ideas

Here are 5 strong talk topics we're considering for CFP submission:

** 1. Building Production-Ready RAG Systems with OpenSearch
/Track: Search & Apache Lucene/

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is transforming how we build AI applications.
This talk covers practical patterns for building production RAG systems:
- Chunking strategies for different document types
- Hybrid search combining BM25 + vector similarity
- Reranking pipelines for improved relevance
- Evaluation frameworks and metrics (beyond just NDCG)

** 2. From Elasticsearch to OpenSearch: A Migration Playbook
/Track: Operating OpenSearch/

Real-world lessons from migrating a 50TB+ Elasticsearch cluster to OpenSearch:
- Zero-downtime migration strategies
- Index compatibility and breaking changes
- Performance tuning post-migration
- Cost optimization on self-managed vs. managed services

** 3. Anomaly Detection at Scale: Lessons from Production
/Track: Analytics, Security, and Observability/

Operating OpenSearch's ML-powered anomaly detection across 1000+ detectors:
- Detector configuration best practices
- Handling seasonality and trend changes
- Alert fatigue reduction techniques
- Integration with incident response workflows

** 4. OpenSearch as a Vector Database: Performance Deep Dive
/Track: Search & Apache Lucene/

Benchmarking OpenSearch's k-NN capabilities against purpose-built vector DBs:
- HNSW vs. IVF index comparison
- Memory vs. disk trade-offs
- Quantization techniques for scale
- Real-world latency and recall measurements

** 5. Building a Security Analytics Platform with OpenSearch
/Track: Analytics, Security, and Observability/

Architecting a SIEM-like platform using OpenSearch Security Analytics:
- Log ingestion patterns at scale (100K+ events/sec)
- Detection rule authoring and Sigma compatibility
- Threat hunting workflows
- Compliance reporting and audit trails

* Getting Started

** Creating a New Talk Proposal

1. Copy the template:
   #+begin_src bash
   gmake new-talk NAME=my-talk-name
   #+end_src

2. Edit your proposal in Emacs/org-mode:
   #+begin_src bash
   emacs talks/proposals/my-talk-name.org
   #+end_src

3. Validate with Vale:
   #+begin_src bash
   gmake lint
   #+end_src

4. Tangle code examples:
   #+begin_src elisp
   M-x org-babel-tangle
   #+end_src

5. Check CFP deadline:
   #+begin_src bash
   gmake check-deadline
   #+end_src

** Vale Linting

The project includes custom Vale rules for CFP quality:

| Rule             | Purpose                                      |
|------------------+----------------------------------------------|
