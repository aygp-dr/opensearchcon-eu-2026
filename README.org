** Vale Linting

The project includes custom Vale rules for CFP quality:

| Rule             | Purpose                                      |
|------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| AbstractLength   | Ensure abstract under 300 words              |
| TechnicalTerms   | Consistent OpenSearch terminology            |
| Buzzwords        | Flag overused marketing speak                |
| PassiveVoice     | Encourage active, engaging writing           |
| Hedging          | Remove weak, uncertain language              |
